# CoffeeTimer
DualTimer of coffee making using OLED and Arduino
Pulling a perfect coffee requires tight control of a number of variables. The grinder dispenses a fixed dose of coffee using the correct grind setting into a portafilter basket. The portafilter fits into the coffee machine and machine is run. If all is well there should be a pause of four seconds before the coffee starts flowing followed by a steady flow for twenty five seconds dispensing a 1.5 oz shot.

This coffee shot timer is designed to make timing the pre and flow times as easy as possible. The white button is the timer button. Press once to start, twice to start the second timer and a third time to stop. The red button is to reset.

The project is based round an Arduino Uno and uses an OLED SSD1306, available for a few pounds on eBay. 
I used the Adafruit libraries with the help of this YouTube tutorial to drive the OLED. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEZGn0zYHiE
